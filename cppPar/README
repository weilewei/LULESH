LULESH 2.0, parallel algorithms version, ported by David Olsen
(dolsen@nvidia.com) from the original version of LULESH found at
https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/co-design/lulesh

The Makefile is configured for use c++ cpu version 

To build, set your environment to include the g++ compiler in the PATH
variable, and then type "make".

To run, type "make run".  This will invoke the command:

./lulesh2.0 -s 150 -p

Where
"-p" prints intermediary results
"-s" defines the size of the problem to use.  For benchmarking, a size
	of 150 is typically used but can be changed to suit the need.
